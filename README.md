## Ved Bulsara's personal porfolio website  

> - Website hosted by Netlify :
    [https://vedbulsara.netlify.app/](https://legacy-vedbulsara.netlify.app/)


> - Website hosted by Github page :
    https://vedbulsara04.github.io/vedbulsara/
    
> Note : I suggest to visit my website via a laptop/PC browser rather than a phone as it would look messy when viewed from a mobile browser.

> P.S. I will be adding Media Query to my website to fix the above problem soon!
